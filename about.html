                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>During the past few years I have worked in the Automotive Industry within the United States Navy. I have been able to develop my leadership ability and impact the lives of my junior employees in a positive way. I have been successful in meeting organizational goals and solving complex problems under extreme pressure.
                <br>
                <p>I am currently enrolled as a student at National University in La Jolla, CA seeking a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have so far loved all my coursework and am excited for what my future learning brings me.</p>

                    <blockquote>"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it." - Steve Jobs
